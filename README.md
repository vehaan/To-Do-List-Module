# To-Do-List-Module
An offline To-Do List Module.
It is offline which means only a single user can use it on a particular device.
It can be made to be used based on user login information by feeding unique id of each user in the user_id of database.

# How it works
Create a database in mysql named "testing".
Import the sql file which will add the required table to your database.
Thats it! Good to go.
